            <h2>My Work</h2>
            <h3>Personal Branding Design</h3>
            <p>The design defines my core values, skills, and personality qualities through hitting the keywords in my portfolio identification project, which include boldness, charm, and meticulous. I chose blue, gray, black, and orange as theme colors since they reflect my personality and the emotions I want to provoke. In a psychological sense, the majority usage of the blue hue represents calm, cleanliness, and harmony. The design output maintains a consistent appearance across different scenarios in everyday living. This includes materials such as my business card, promotion posters, stationery, and so on.The design created continuous visual recognition and helped to develop my own brand.</p>
